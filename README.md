# markov_text
Markov text generator in ES6 (I guess)

Takes some input text, builds a big markov chain, then spits out some more text that should sound like the original but mean nothing.

I originally wrote this in coffeescript and compiled it with gulp. It required a huge number of dependencies and a build script and you needed to have node.js installed etc etc. Recently I realized that much of that was a waste of time, and for a small project like this using plain Javascript is much better. Therefore, I translated it directly into ES6.
